## Overview

This project presents an automated breast tumor segmentation framework using a 2D U-Net architecture implemented with the MONAI (Medical Open Network for AI) framework. The system processes breast MRI scans and generates multi-class segmentation masks containing:

* Background
* Tumor
* Glandular Tissue
* Skin

The primary objective is to provide an efficient and computationally lightweight segmentation pipeline suitable for systems with limited GPU resources while maintaining clinically relevant segmentation performance.

## Features

* Automated breast MRI tumor segmentation
* 2D U-Net implementation using MONAI
* NIfTI (.nii/.nii.gz) medical image support
* Voxel spacing standardization through resampling
* Slice-based preprocessing pipeline
* Multi-class segmentation
* Data augmentation support
* Multiple intensity normalization strategies
* Post-processing to reduce false positives
* Quantitative evaluation using standard segmentation metrics

---

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Duke Breast Cancer MRI Dataset derived from the multicenter breast DCE-MRI benchmark dataset.

### Training Dataset

* 30 MRI volumes

### Testing Dataset

* 10 MRI volumes

### Segmentation Classes

| Label ID | Class            |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 0        | Background       |
| 1        | Tumor            |
| 2        | Glandular Tissue |
| 3        | Skin             |

* Pair image-label volumes
* Volume-level train-validation split
* Prevent patient-level data leakage

### 2. Preprocessing

* Voxel spacing resampling
* Axial slice extraction
* Padding to 400 × 400 pixels
* Intensity normalization

### 3. Data Augmentation

* Random rotations
* Random flipping

### 4. Model Training

* MONAI-based 2D U-Net
* Dice Cross-Entropy Loss
* Validation monitoring using Dice Score

### 5. Inference
